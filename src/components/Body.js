              <p>
                My goal is to secure a position as a junior software developer at Perennia, a company known for its excellence. Joining Perennia would provide me with the opportunity to enhance my current skills and expand my knowledge as a developer. I'm mostly excited about the idea of collaborating with an elite group of developers, as this would help push me to new heights in my career. With determination and a passion for coding, I'm ready to contribute and learn from the best at Perennia.

              <p>
                I've always been fascinated by tech and art, from oil painting to building gaming computers I eventually found my passion for coding when playing with C# and unity as a hobby. This led me to pursue web development as a career path. I decided to attend Lighthouse Labs, where I withnessed the gratifying experience of bringing my creations to life (using ReactJs). Since then I have been refining my skills with the current languages I know as I'm not trying to be a jack of all trades and master of none.

              <p>
                In short I am a coder by day and gamer/ weight lifter by night! I also enjoy practicing MMA and reading books in my spare time. I'm a very social person, I love meeting new people and having big meals as a group (I love food), besides food always taste best when eating with friends! I'm known for having high energy levels but I'm also known for being "like a dad" since I always sleep so early... but who doesn't love sleep?? ðŸ˜´
